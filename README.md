# **How To Train Your Dragon** :boy::dragon:
This is my favorite movie of all time! This movie is about a boy named Hiccup who saved a dragon and named him Toothless. Well, Hiccup didn't actually saved Toothless but he shot him. But in the end they became best friends. <br>
How To Train Your Dragon has three movies all in all. <br>
**Here are some characters in HTTYD:**
1. Hiccup
2. Astrid (Hiccup's Girlfriend)
3. Stoick (Hiccup's Dad)
4. Snotlout
5. Fishlegs
6. Tuffnut
7. Ruffnut
